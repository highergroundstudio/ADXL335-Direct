# ADXL335-Direct
This is a direct plug quickstart for the SMAKN ADXL335 to Arduino

#Setup
- Plug the ADXL335 into the Arduino (I soldered mine with the accelerameter SMD facing up)
- GND plugins into A0 thus VCC plugs into A4

- Open and upload the Arduino Sketch
- Open the serial monitor or plotter to see the data (make sure to set baud rate to 115200)
